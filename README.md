- 👋 Hi, I’m @lotharthequiet
- 👀 I’m interested in all things networing, cybersecurity, and CTFs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning general red team cyber security concepts, and penetration testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CTFs, red team initiatives, anywhere that I can put my scripting skills to the test, and fighting communism (and world hunger).
- 📫 How to reach me lotharthequiet@gmail.com
