- 👋 Hi, I’m @lotharthequiet
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Python, networking, cybersecurity, and CTFs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python, general red team cyber security concepts, and penetration testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects, CTFs, red team initiatives, anywhere that I can put my scripting skills to the test. Also fighting communism, world hunger, general ignorance, and idiocy.
